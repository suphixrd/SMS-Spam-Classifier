# SMS-Spam-Classifier
Here's a machine learning project for classifying SMS messages as spam or ham (normal) using Python and scikit-learn.


Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust classifier that can accurately identify unsolicited or deceptive "spam" messages from legitimate "ham" messages. This helps in filtering unwanted communication, improving user experience and security.

Core Technologies
Python: The main programming language used.

scikit-learn: A powerful machine learning library used for building and evaluating the classification model.

Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.

Jupyter Notebook: The development environment where the project's code and analysis are documented.

TF-IDF Vectorizer: A key component for converting raw text messages into a numerical format that the machine learning model can understand.

Multinomial Naive Bayes: The chosen classification algorithm, known for its efficiency and strong performance on text classification tasks.
